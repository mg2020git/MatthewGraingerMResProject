# Matthew Shaun Grainger's CMEE MRes Research Project Repository
This project investigates the reproducibility of microbial community assembly using network analysis. Raw data was sourced from Replaying the tape of ecology to domesticate wild microbiota https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.07.07.548163 (Pascual-Garcia et al., 2023), which is currently undergoing review. This data consists of communities sampled from 275 tree holes. Each community has 1 starting sample and 4 final samples from after a period of growth within a controlled environment. These samples were also grouped into community classes via their pairwise beta-diversity similarity. Here, we construct 4 co-occurrence networks - 1 across starting samples, 1 across starting samples whilst taking into account community classes, 1 across final samples, and 1 across final samples whilst taking into account community classes.
