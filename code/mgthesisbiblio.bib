	abstract = {Humanity has benefited from the domestication of nature and there is an increasing need to predict and control ecosystems. Domesticating bacterial communities would be particularly useful. Bacterial communities play key roles in global biogeochemical cycles, in industry (e.g. sewage treatment, fermented food and drink manufacturing), in agriculture (e.g. by fixing nitrogen and suppressing pathogens), and in human health and animal husbandry. There is therefore great interest in understanding bacterial community dynamics so that they can be controlled and engineered to optimise ecosystem services. We assessed the reproducibility and predictability of bacterial community dynamics by creating a frozen archive of hundreds of naturally-occuring bacterial communities that were repeatedly revived and tracked in a standardised, complex environment. Replicate communities followed reproducible trajectories and the community dynamics could be closely mapped to ecosystem functioning. However, even under standardised conditions, the communities exhibited tipping-points, where a small difference in initial community composition created divergent outcomes. We accurately predicted ecosystem outcomes based on initial bacterial community composition, and identified the conditions under which divergent ecosystem outcomes may be expected. In conclusion, we have shown the feasibility of our approach to reproducibly achieve predictable compositions and functions from wild communities. Nonetheless, the predictability of community trajectories, and therefore their utility in domestication, requires detailed knowledge of rugged compositional landscapes where ecosystem properties are not the inevitable result of prevailing environmental conditions but can be tilted toward different outcomes depending on the initial community composition.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

abstract = {Abstract Environmental microbiome engineering is emerging as a potential avenue for climate change mitigation. In this process, microbial inocula are introduced to natural microbial communities to tune activities that regulate the long-term stabilization of carbon in ecosystems. In this review, we outline the process of environmental engineering and synthesize key considerations about ecosystem functions to target, means of sourcing microorganisms, strategies for designing microbial inocula, methods to deliver inocula, and the factors that enable inocula to establish within a resident community and modify an ecosystem function target. Recent work, enabled by high-throughput technologies and modeling approaches, indicate that microbial inocula designed from the top-down, particularly through directed evolution, may generally have a higher chance of establishing within existing microbial communities than other historical approaches to microbiome engineering. We address outstanding questions about the determinants of inocula establishment and provide suggestions for further research about the possibilities and challenges of environmental microbiome engineering as a tool to combat climate change.},

The availability of large-scale metagenomic sequencing data can facilitate the understanding of microbial ecosystems in unprecedented detail. However, current computational methods for predicting ecological interactions are hampered by insufficient statistical resolution and limited computational scalability. They also do not integrate metadata, which can reduce the interpretability of predicted ecological patterns. Here, we present FlashWeave, a computational approach based on a flexible Probabilistic Graphical Model framework that integrates metadata and predicts direct microbial interactions from heterogeneous microbial abundance data sets with hundreds of thousands of samples. FlashWeave outperforms state-of-the-art methods on diverse benchmarking challenges in terms of runtime and accuracy. We use FlashWeave to analyze a cross-study data set of 69,818 publicly available human gut samples and produce, to the best of our knowledge, the largest and most diverse network of predicted, direct gastrointestinal microbial interactions to date.

abstract={The importance of microbial communities (MCs) cannot be overstated. MCs underpin the biogeochemical cycles of the earth's soil, oceans and the atmosphere, and perform ecosystem functions that impact plants, animals and humans. Yet our ability to predict and manage the function of these highly complex, dynamically changing communities is limited. Building predictive models that link MC composition to function is a key emerging challenge in microbial ecology. Here, we argue that addressing this challenge requires close coordination of experimental data collection and method development with mathematical model building. We discuss specific examples where model--experiment integration has already resulted in important insights into MC function and structure. We also highlight key research questions that still demand better integration of experiments and models. We argue that such integration is needed to achieve significant progress in our understanding of MC dynamics and function, and we make specific practical suggestions as to how this could be achieved.},

abstract={The activities of complex communities of microbes affect biogeochemical transformations in natural, managed and engineered ecosystems. Meaningfully defining what constitutes a community of interacting microbial populations is not trivial, but is important for rigorous progress in the field. Important elements of research in microbial community ecology include the analysis of functional pathways for nutrient resource and energy flows, mechanistic understanding of interactions between microbial populations and their environment, and the emergent properties of the complex community. Some emergent properties mirror those analyzed by community ecologists who study plants and animals: biological diversity, functional redundancy and system stability. However, because microbes possess mechanisms for the horizontal transfer of genetic information, the metagenome may also be considered as a community property.},
